## üé® Design Rationale

### Vision & Problem Statement

The IRIS Dashboard was designed to provide NITK students with a centralized, intuitive interface for managing their academic life. The design prioritizes quick access to frequently used features while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic that reduces cognitive load.

### Design Philosophy

**1. Dark Theme Excellence**
- **Professional Dark UI**: Black (#000000) background with dark gray (#1a1a1a) panels creates a sophisticated, modern look that reduces eye strain during extended use
- **Contrast & Readability**: White text on dark backgrounds provides excellent readability while maintaining visual hierarchy
- **Energy Efficiency**: Dark themes consume less power on OLED displays, extending battery life on mobile devices

**2. Color Psychology & Branding**
- **Cyan Blue (#0ea5e9)**: Primary action color representing trust, intelligence, and academic excellence
- **Purple (#8b5cf6)**: Secondary accent for creative elements and variety in data visualization
- **Gradient Approach**: Smooth gradients on stat cards create visual interest without overwhelming the interface
- **Color Coding**: Each section uses consistent colors to aid quick visual scanning

**3. Information Architecture**
- **Left Sidebar Navigation**: Fixed sidebar with clear iconography provides consistent wayfinding
- **Dashboard-First Approach**: Most critical information (CGPA, Credits, Semester) prominently displayed at the top
- **Tab-Based Content**: Announcement, Attendance, Timetable, and Courses accessible via horizontal tabs
- **Events Sidebar**: Dedicated right panel for upcoming campus events maintains awareness without cluttering the main view

**4. Visual Hierarchy**
- **Stat Cards**: Large, gradient-filled cards with bold typography draw immediate attention to key metrics
- **Rounded Corners**: Consistent 24px border radius (rounded-3xl) creates a friendly, modern feel
- **White Space**: Generous padding and spacing prevent information overload
- **Icon Support**: Lucide React icons provide clear visual cues for each section

**5. User Experience Principles**
- **Frequently Used Section**: Quick access buttons to common tasks reduce navigation time
- **Flagship Event Badges**: Special highlighting for important campus events
- **Filter Options**: "My Events" vs "All Events" and "This Week" vs "Next Week" provide personalized views
- **Customization**: "Customize layout" button empowers users to personalize their dashboard
